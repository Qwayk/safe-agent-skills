title: subscriptionContractUpdate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a draft of an existing
  [`SubscriptionContract`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract).
  The draft captures the current state of the contract and allows incremental
  modifications through draft mutations such as
  [`subscriptionDraftLineAdd`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftLineAdd),
  [`subscriptionDraftDiscountAdd`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftDiscountAdd),
  and
  [`subscriptionDraftUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftUpdate).


  Changes remain in draft state and don't affect the live contract until
  committed. After you've made all necessary changes to the draft, commit it
  using
  [`subscriptionDraftCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftCommit)
  to apply the updates to the original contract.
